react-native-image-crop-picker version >= 0.25.0. Otherwise use version < 0.25.0.\n\n## Usage\n\nImport library\n\n```javascript\nimport ImagePicker from 'react-native-image-crop-picker';\n```\n\n### Select from gallery\n\nCall single image picker with cropping\n```javascript\nImagePicker.openPicker({\n  width: 300,\n  height: 400,\n  cropping: true\n}).then(image => {\n  console.log(image);\n});\n```\n\nCall multiple image picker\n\n```javascript\nImagePicker.openPicker({\n  multiple: true\n}).then(images => {\n  console.log(images);\n});\n```\n\nSelect video only from gallery\n\n```javascript\nImagePicker.openPicker({\n  mediaType: \"video\",\n}).then((video) => {\n  console.log(video);\n});\n```\n\n**Android: The prop 'cropping' has been known to cause videos not to be displayed in the gallery on Android. Please do not set cropping to true when selecting videos.**\n\n\n### Select from camera \n\n#### Image\n\n```javascript\nImagePicker.openCamera({\n  width: 300,\n  height: 400,\n  cropping: true,\n}).then(image => {\n  console.log(image);\n});\n```\n\n#### Video\n\n```javascript\nImagePicker.openCamera({\n  mediaType: 'video',\n}).then(image => {\n  console.log(image);\n});\n```\n\n### Crop picture\n\n```javascript\nImagePicker.openCropper({\n  path: 'my-file-path.jpg',\n  width: 300,\n  height: 400\n}).then(image => {\n  console.log(image);\n});\n```\n\n### Optional cleanup\n\nModule is creating tmp images which are going to be cleaned up automatically somewhere in the future. If you want to force cleanup, you can use `clean` to clean all tmp files, or `cleanSingle(path)` to clean single tmp file.\n\n```javascript\nImagePicker.clean().then(() => {\n  console.log('removed all tmp images from tmp directory');\n}).catch(e => {\n  alert(e);\n});\n```\n\n### Request Object\n\n| Property                                |                   Type                   | Description                           |\n| --------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------- |\n| cropping                                |           bool (default false)           | Enable or disable cropping               |\n| width                                   |                  number                  | Width of result image when used with `cropping` option |\n| height                                  |                  number                  | Height of result image when used with `cropping` option |\n| multiple                                |           bool (default false)           | Enable or disable multiple image selection |\n| writeTempFile (ios only)                |           bool (default true)            | When set to false, does not write temporary files for the selected images.

More info here https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/62229. Depending on what features you use, you also may need `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` keys.\n  \n#### (Optional) Step 2 - To localizate the camera / gallery / cropper text buttons\n\n- Open your Xcode project\n- Go to your project settings by opening the project name on the Navigation (left side)\n- Select your project in the project list \n- Should be into the Info tab and add in Localizations the language your app was missing throughout the +\n- Rebuild and you should now have your app camera and gallery with the classic ios text in the language you added.\n\n### Android\n\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** Add the following to your `build.gradle`'s repositories section. (android/build.gradle)\n\n```gradle\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n      mavenLocal()\n      jcenter()\n      maven { url \"$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android\" }\n\n      // ADD THIS\n      maven { url 'https://maven.google.com' }\n\n      // ADD THIS\n      maven { url \"https://www.jitpack.io\" }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- Add `useSupportLibrary` (android/app/build.gradle)\n\n```gradle\nandroid {\n    ...\n\n    defaultConfig {\n        ...\n        vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true\n        ...\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n- Use Android SDK >= 26 (android/app/build.gradle)\n\n```gradle\nandroid {\n    compileSdkVersion 27\n    buildToolsVersion \"27.0.3\"\n    ...\n    \n    defaultConfig {\n      ...\n      targetSdkVersion 27\n      ...\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n- Minimum Gradle version if you are using react-native-image-crop-picker >= 0.35.0\n\n```\n3.3.3\n3.4.3\n3.5.4\n3.6.4\n4.0.1\n```\n\nReference for more details https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker/issues/1406\n\n- [Optional] If you want to use camera picker in your project, add following to `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`\n  - `<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\"/>`\n\n- [Optional] If you want to use front camera, also add following to `app/src/main/\nAndroidManifest.xml`\n  - `<uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.camera\" android:required=\"false\" />`\n  - `<uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.camera.front\" android:required=\"false\" />`\n\n## TO DO\n\n- [ ] [Android] Standardize multiple select\n- [ ] [Android] Video compression\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
